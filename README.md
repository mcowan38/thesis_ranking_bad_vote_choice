# Ranking Bad: The Chemistry of Ranked-Choice Voting
## Abstract
Crowder-Meyer et al. (2023) demonstrated that BIPOC candidates – those identified as Black, Asian, or Hispanic – consistently faced disadvantages in ranked-choice voting (RCV) elections, regardless of whether they occurred in high or low-information contexts – where candidates’ party labels were known or unknown. Through partial replication and extension of their methodology, this study examines variations in Canadian voter support for candidates across racial and ethnic lines in hypothetical RCV scenarios, assessing the effectiveness of partisan cues in counteracting biases against Black, Asian, and Indigenous candidates. Our findings indicate that BIPOC candidates experience similar disadvantages in Canadian RCV elections, with voters engaging in negative partisanship and affinity voting behaviours across the political spectrum. However, the inclusion of candidates’ party labels appears to neutralize these biases. As a preliminary exploration, this study sheds light on the complex interplay between electoral systems, information dissemination, and voter biases in the Canadian context, laying the foundation for further research into how partisan cues might mitigate BIPOC candidate disadvantages in Canadian elections.
